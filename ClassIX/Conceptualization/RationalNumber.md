# Rational number
## A number 'r' is called a rational number, if it can be written in the form p/q
## where p and q are integers and q != 0


# Problem 1
## So for this case we want to create an algorithm to find n number of rational number btween two rational number
## let say p and x.

# Theory
## There are multiple ways to do it lets dicuss some of the ways
## Case 1: we can do it  by getting the (p + x)/2 and then continue finding it
## case 2: we can do it by multiplying the denominator and numenator with (n+1) and then just increment the numerator value to get the 
## desired values
