# Locate √3 on the number line. 

## Let's start... 
 
-.1 Step: 
          Draw a number line horizontal and mark points to integers, points are -3,-2,-1,0,1,2 and 3at equiaval intervals  of 1 unit each .

-.2 Step:
         Now consider OA=1 unit on the number line.

-.3 Step:  
        construct a perpendicular line AB=1 unit.

-.4 Step: 
         Join OB applying the Pythagorean theorem. we get (√OA²+AB²)= √(1²+1²)=√2
    Thus OB = √2 .

-.5 Step:
         Pythagoras theorem we see that OD=√(√2)² + 1² = √3
      
       Using compass with centre O and radius OD. draw an arc which intersects the number line at the point Q.

       Thus OD represent √3 is irrational number.
