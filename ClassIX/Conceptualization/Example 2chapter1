# Find five rational number between 1and 2

## Solution 2:

- . 1 Step :
            At first write down number given 1 and 2 . Then we can express 1 upon 1 and 2 upon 1 .

- . 2 Step : 
            Here the denominator of both are 1 . So for five rational number we have to multiplying with both rational number by 5+1=6 .

- . 3 Step :
            We have multiplying the number 6 with 1/1 and 2/1 . Then we get 6/6 and 12/6.

- . 4 Step :
            So between 6 to 12 we got five number and by this we can form five rational number 7/6 , 8/6 , 9/6, 10/6 and 11/6 .
       Therefore the five rational number between 1 and 2 are 7/6 ,4/3 , 3/2 , 5/3 and 11/6 .

This is the process to find five rational number.
