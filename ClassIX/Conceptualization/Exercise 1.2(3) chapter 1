# Show how √5 can be represent on the number line. 

## Let us solve it....

-.1 Stage :
          At first draw a number line, where Zero as the middle point. To left of this point are -1 , -2 and right side are 1 , 2 and 3. There are each unit =1 

-.2 Stage :
          Now draw 90° angle on point 2, with use of compass.

-.3 Stage :
           Then take 1unit and cut it on the perpendicular. 
  (Here point 0 is 'O'and point 2 is 'A' and perpendicular point is 'B' )
     So, OA = 2 unit and AB = 1 unit 

-.4 Stage :
          After that join OB. 
     So, we get "OAB" is a right triangle , where angle OAB = 90°

         according to the theory of Pythagoras ...

               OB²= OA² + AB²
               OB²= (2)²+(1)²
               OB²= 4+1 = 5
                OB =√5

Then draw a circle with radius OB, that intersecting at P .
       (Here P will be located after point A on the number line.) 

      So, The point P is represent √5 on the number line.
