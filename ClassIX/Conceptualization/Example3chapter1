# Locate √2 on the number line. 

## Solution 

- . 1 Step: 
           At first we draw a square. 

- . 2 Step:
           Then we consider the four side of the square are OABC.The length of each arm is 1 unit. 

- . 3 Step:
           According to Pythagoras method  OB = √1 square + 1 square = √2 

           ## Another way 

- . 4 Step:
           First we draw a number line. The middle point of the line is O, I to the left of the point -1 , -2 ,-3 and to the right side +1 ,+2 , +3 unit. 

- . 5 Step:
           Let OA = 1 unit long, I then we take a protector make a 90° mark ,After that join the point to A.
   
   Then, on the Compass we take a length of 1 unit and mark an arc on this line and get B as 1 unit and then we join OB,this length OB is √2 unit and that is the length we need on the number line. 
     
   So we keep the Compass on point O take length OB and cut an arc on the number line that called point P, which is √2 unit.
